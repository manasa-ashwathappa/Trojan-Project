Design: aes_128.v
Vulnerability ID: T2
Model: gpt-4.1-mini
Attempts: 1

Explanation:
A Trojan shift register monitors the lower 4 bits of the AES state to detect a covert trigger pattern "1010". Upon detection, a counter initiates sequential leakage of the AES key, outputting 4-bit key nibbles via an added output port without affecting normal AES operations.

Trigger:
The Trojan activates when the lower 4 bits of the AES state equal the binary pattern 4'b1010 in consecutive clock cycles, detected by a 4-bit shift register. This patterned signal serves as a covert trigger to begin key leakage.

Payload:
Once triggered, the Trojan leaks the 128-bit AES key serially in 4-bit chunks over 16 clock cycles through an added output port, enabling covert extraction of secret key material without disrupting standard functionality.

Taxonomy:

Abstraction level: Register-transfer level
